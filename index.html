<p>This notebook is to help learn by actually writing code. Notes are both "on-screen" and within the actual code. (In other words, open this page in an editior to see "under the hood")</p>

 <!--  Rules:
  1. Content is Everything (Content will determine how large things are displayed. Regardless of CSS
  
  2.Order: the order of elements on screen follows the same order they appear in the origninal code "Think top to bottom"
  
  3. Children sit on Parents: By default, all html elements sit on their parents. (if something isnt showing up, it's most likely hidden by under a/the parent) -->
 <!-- <span> allows you to "highlight" text-->
<!--<br> makes a break in the line of code (basically hitting enter)-->

<!-- <div> is used for making divides-->
  <div class=parenttut>
    <h1>a<span>pro</span>grammer</h1>
  </div>
<p>A <strong>Div</strong> is a content division element
  it allows you to divide content into seperate "boxes" which makes it easier for coder to interact with. To get a better understanding of the order of  parents and children take a look at the red box labeled programmer.
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
   The red box is the div. It appears "last" on screen.
  <br>
  Next to be seen or "appear on screen" would be the blue h1 because it sits on its parent, the red div.<br>
  Finally the yellow span sits on top of its parent the blue h1<br><br><br>to summarize when coding the user will see your coding like this: Yellow first then blue finally red.<br> This happens because
    Red is blue's parent and yellows is blue's child
  
<br>  If that didnt make sense, think of them as layers instead, red is on the bottom, blue "sits"
on red, and yellow is seated on top of blue.  </p>

 <!-- This lil section deals with both HTML n CSS -->


  
  <p class="introtwo">With the class attribute, you can give an element a "name" to make things easier to work with.
  Using the id attribute allows you to give an element a "name" thats unique or specific to the element in question

<p>The asterisk (*) aka universal selector for CSS, matches all elements in a document, allowing you to apply styles universally.</p>
<p>It can be useful for resetting styles or applying a default style across all elements, but should be used carefully to avoid performance issues.</p>
<br>
<p>Theres 3 types of CSS:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>In-Line: Applied directly within an HTML element's style attribute, affecting only that specific element.</li>
	<li>Internal: Defined within a style tag in the head section of an HTML document, influencing the entire page.</li>
	<li>External: Contained in a separate .css file linked to the HTML document, allowing for consistent styling across multiple pages.</li>
	</ol>
